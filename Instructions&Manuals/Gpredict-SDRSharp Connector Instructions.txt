PLUGIN DOWNLOAD AND SETUP:

1) Download the SDRSharp.GpredictConnector from Alex Wahl's Github: https://github.com/alexwahl/SDRSharp.GpredictConnector/releases/download/v0.3/SDRSharp.GpredictConnector-v0.3.zip

2) Extract the downloaded file into the sdrsharp-x86/Plugins folder. Read the .readme file for more information. At the end of this step the sdrsharp-x86/Plugins folder should contain a folder labelled SDRSharp.GpredictConnector-v0.3. Inside the SDRSharp.GpredictConnector-v0.3 folder there should be an SDRSharp.GpredictConnector.dll file, as well as some MD files.

3) In the sdrsharp-x86 folder, find the plugins.xml file. Open this file and create a new cell row above the </sharpPlugins> cell. Copy-paste the following into the cell: 
<add key =”DDE Tracking Client” value =”SDRSharp.DDETracker.DdeTrackingPlugin,SDRSharp.DDETracker” /> 	
Make sure that the <> symbols are included.

4) Save and exit the .xml file. Run SDRSharp and use the menu button (three horizontal bars) in the top-left of the UI. Find the GpredictConnector* tab and open it. If there is no GpredictConnector* tab, the plugin has not been installed correctly.

5) Click the "enable" radio button to enable the plugin. Note that the "Server Status" section should say "listening on port xxxx", where xxxx is the port. By default, this port is 4532.

GPREDICT SETUP:

1) Gpredict should be downloaded, with a useable module set up for tracking. For instructions on setting up a GPredict module, refer to the instructions entitled "

2) Go to Edit/Preferances then go to the Interfaces tab. Click the "Add New" button.

3) Give the radio a name (like Radio McRadioFace) and ensure that Host is localhost and the port used is the same as the one seen in step 5 of PLUGIN DOWNLOAD AND SETUP. The radio type can be RX only, PTT status can be None, VFO Up/Down is Not Applicable, LO Down is 0 and LO Up is 0. Click "OK" to create the radio.

COMBINED OPERATION:

*Assuming all software is closed at the beginning of this section.

1) Run SDR# with the SDR plugged into your computer and the "Play" button engaged. Go to the GpredictConnector* tab and click the "Engage" check mark.

2) Run Gpredict and select the satellite you want to receive from. Use the drop-down menu to select the "Radio Control" window.

3) In the Radio Control window, in the "Settings" section, ensure that Device 1 is set to the radio created in the GPREDICT SETUP section (radio McRadioFace, or other). Device 2 can be None. The cycle can be changed to greater than 1000msec, but not less. It is suggested that this remains at default.

4) In the "Target" section of the Radio Control window, select the satellite you are receiving from. Click the "T" button to tune the radio to that satellite's transponder. To initialize the connection between GPredict and SDR#, click the "Track" button. 

5) View SDR# and ensure that the value seen in the "Downlink" section of the Gpredict Radio Control window is the same as that displayed by SDR#.

6) Once the track is complete, deselect the "Track" button. Another satellite can be selected and tracked immediately, but remember to click the "T" button every time the target satellite is switched.
