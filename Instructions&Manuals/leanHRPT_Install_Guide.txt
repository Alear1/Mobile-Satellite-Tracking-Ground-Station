Installation guide for leanHRPT decoder and demodulator

leanHRPT Demodulator github: https://github.com/Xerbo/LeanHRPT-Demod

leanHRPT Decoder github: https://github.com/Xerbo/LeanHRPT-Decode


NOTE: the leanHRPT Demodulator can be used to receive and demodulate a signal LIVE.

LINUX Guide (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):

First, for the decoder:

0) run the following command in the command line: sudo apt install soapysdr-module-all

1) Save the following into the folder of your choosing: https://github.com/Xerbo/LeanHRPT-Decode/releases/download/v0.5.1/LeanHRPT_Decode-x86_64-hotfix.AppImage

2) Go into the folder containing LeanHRPT_Decode-x86_64-hotfix.AppImage and enter the following command: sudo chmod a+x LeanHRPT_Decode-x86_64-hotfix.AppImage

3) Double-click or run LeanHRPT_Decode-x86_64-hotfix.AppImage to test that it works

Next, for the demodulator:

1) Save the following into the folder of your choosing: https://github.com/Xerbo/LeanHRPT-Demod/releases/download/v0.1.2/LeanHRPT_Demod-x86_64.AppImage

2) Go into the folder containing LeanHRPT_Demod-x86_64.AppImage and enter the following command: sudo chmod a+x LeanHRPT_Demod-x86_64.AppImage

3) Double-click or run LeanHRPT_Demod-x86_64.AppImage to test that it works

To get an image from an SDR# recording:

1) Set the demodulator to receive WAV files (as output by the SDR# record function)

2) SDR# only outputs recordings in 1.95 Gb files, which means one pass can be made up of 5 or 6 individual .wav recording files. For each recording file, set
  the input file in the demodulator as that file, then set the output file to something simple (ex: A1 for the first output).
  
3) Run the demodulator

4) Now set the input file to the next .wav recording file and MAKE SURE to set the output file as a different output file (ex: A2 for the second output).
  Then run the demodulator again.

5) Continue iterating through the recording files, changing the names of the output files as you go.

6) Once the last recording .wav file has been demodulated, open the command line and navigate to the folder where the output files have been saved (The loacation
  of examples A1, A2, etc.)
  
7) Run the following command to combine all the files (Using A as the example): cat A1 A2 A3 A4 > A.bin
  -Note that the newly created file A.bin MUST have the .bin file extension for the decoder to find it
  
8) Open the decoder and open the newly concatenated file. It should decode automatically.
