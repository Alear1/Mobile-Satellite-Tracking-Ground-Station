Improvements for pointing mechanism:

-Find north better \n
-make wiring nicer
-build weather sheild for the mechanism
-convert all structural mount brackets to weld-nut size bolts
-convert AZ motor gear to metal mount
-convert AZ shaft gear to containin nuts
-(software) create more data in struct for data passing, specifically for current state
-(software) connect LCD and buttons to remote control nano for direct interaction with system
-(software) implement hard 2-spin maximum
-(software) kill or feed the gremlin that sometimes appears and gives the motors p-control


Far-future:
-encoders on motor shafts
-potentiometer or other electronic level built into antenna mount
-limit switches
-
