Improvements for pointing mechanism:

-Wire Holder for Arduino

-Tripod leg levelling feet

-Fix tripod wobble

-Sighting scope/piece of pipe for the antenna booms

-Redesign AZ motor mount

-Find north better

-build weather sheild for the mechanism

-convert all structural mount brackets to weld-nut size bolts

-convert AZ shaft gear to containin nuts

-improve gear profile

-Add a temperature sensor (for now we have the infrared temperature sensors)

-(software) create more data in struct for data passing, specifically for current state

-(software) connect LCD and buttons to remote control nano for direct interaction with system

-(software) implement hard 2-spin maximum

-(software) kill or feed the gremlin that sometimes appears and gives the motors p-control

-(software) create a replacement for hamlib with a GUI for direct user interference


Far-future:

-encoders on motor shafts

-potentiometer or other electronic level built into antenna mount

-limit switches

-create documentation for the sun pointing calibration method

Completed:

-make wiring nicer

-convert AZ motor gear to metal mount

-new antenna adapters
