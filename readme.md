# Carleton University Mobile Satellite Tracking Ground Station

Documentation and firmware for the Carleton Mechanical and Aerospace Satellite Tracking Ground Station Project.


Improvements for pointing mechanism:

-Find north better

DONE-make wiring nicer

-build weather sheild for the mechanism

-convert all structural mount brackets to weld-nut size bolts

-convert AZ motor gear to metal mount

-convert AZ shaft gear to containin nuts

-improve gear profile

-new antenna adapters

-Add a temperature sensor (for now we have the infrared temperature sensors)

-(software) create more data in struct for data passing, specifically for current state

-(software) connect LCD and buttons to remote control nano for direct interaction with system

-(software) implement hard 2-spin maximum

-(software) kill or feed the gremlin that sometimes appears and gives the motors p-control


Far-future:

-encoders on motor shafts

-potentiometer or other electronic level built into antenna mount

-limit switches

-create documentation for the sun pointing calibration method
