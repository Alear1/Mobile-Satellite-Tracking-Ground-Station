For the breadboard setup:

All my male-male wires have a rounded connectors at the end, the ones given
	to me have square connectors. None of my own male-female wires were
	used for the breadboard setup. Hooman's male-male connectors have
	shrink wrap, mine have plastic.
-Hooman's breadboard is the one with the darker blue - power rail lines.
